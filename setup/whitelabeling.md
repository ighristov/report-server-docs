# Whitelabeling

Whitelabeling enables Report Server customers to remove branding elements in the Report Server web application and [Standalone Report Designer](/report-designer) application and replace them with branding from the customer enterprise. The following elements can be rebranded:

* Colors (Accent Color, Selected Color, Link Color)
* Logo (The logo image should be in PNG, GIF, or JPG file format. Recommended dimensions are 212 x 17 pixels.)
* Favicon (The favicon should be in ICO, PNG, GIF, or JPG file format.)

The whitelabeling feature can be found under Configuration > Whitelabeling. Administrator rights are required to access the Report Server Configuration page.
