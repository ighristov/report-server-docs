# Upgrading Report Server

To upgrade an existing Report Server installation, you can run [Telerik Report Server Installer](/setup/installation).


Telerik Report Server installer replaces existing files in the selected installation folder. 
The installer will preserve existing Data storage and configuration files. 
On configuring the Report Server you can select to re-use the same Data Storage folder.

To remove Telerik Report Server entirely, you can manually clear the content of the folder.

> The Report Server installer will not run if it detects an already installed Report Server of the same or greater version.
