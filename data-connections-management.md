# Data Connections Management



The Data Connections View is a centralized place from which you can manage the connection strings of the reports' data sources. In this way by using a named connection string you can easily change the location of the database without actually modifying the report definitions.

The data connections view provides the following functions:

  - _Search by Name, Data Provider or Connection String. For more information, see [Search]({%slug search%})_

  - _Add a data connection_

A new data connection is defined by a _name_, a _description_, a _data provider_ and a _connection string_.

In order to read, write, or modify connection strings from the Report Server or from the Standalone Report Designer, the user must have permissions for the Data Connections View or they must be assigned the corresponding role - see [User Roles](/user-management/user-roles).

Data connections with duplicate names are not allowed.

  - _Edit a data connection_  
The properties of an existing data connection can be modified at any time.
  - _Delete a data connection_  
You can delete an existing data connection when it is not used any more.
  - _Copy a data connection_  
To create a similar to an existing connection you can simply copy the source connection and modify its properties.
